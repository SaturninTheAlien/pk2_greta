You are free to:
Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.


Under the following terms:

Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license,
and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner,
but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

Proper attribution is satisfied by preserving the following existing elements,
where they are present:
- the original game credits displayed on the intro or title screen, and
- the original in-game links to the official project repository and website.

If these elements are not present due to technical or platform limitations
(e.g. alternative engines or ports), attribution must be provided in a
reasonable and visible manner appropriate for the platform.

NonCommercial — You may not use the game for commercial purposes.

For clarity, the following uses are explicitly permitted and are not considered commercial use:
- creation and distribution of PK2 episodes and other in-game content,
- gameplay recordings, videos, reviews, and live transmissions.


Additional permissions:

1. Non-commercial redistribution of the game through free and open-source
   software package repositories (including Homebrew and Linux distribution package managers
   such as APT, DNF, Pacman, or Nix) is explicitly permitted, provided that:
   - the game is distributed free of charge,
   - no advertisements, sponsorships, or other forms of monetization are involved,
   - proper attribution is preserved.

2. Notwithstanding the NonCommercial clause, Janne Kivilahti and SaturninTheAlien 
   are explicitly and independently permitted to distribute compiled versions
   of the game on the Steam platform.

   This permission applies only to the aforementioned parties and does not
   extend to other distributors.

Dual licensing:

The original authors may grant additional licenses or permissions
on a case-by-case basis.

If you intend to sell this game, generate revenue from it in any form
(excluding your own episodes, gameplay recordings, or live transmissions
which are explicitly permitted under this license),
or distribute it in a manner that does not comply with the terms above,
you must obtain prior permission from the original authors.
